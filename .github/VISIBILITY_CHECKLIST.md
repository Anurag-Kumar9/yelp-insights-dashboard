I'm excited to share my latest project: Yelp Insights Dashboard! 🎉

This production-ready data engineering pipeline demonstrates:
✅ ETL at scale (10GB dataset, 7M reviews)
✅ Performance optimization (43 days → 2 hours!)
✅ ML integration (sentiment analysis, clustering, prediction)
✅ Modern API design (FastAPI + async)
✅ Real-world problem solving

Perfect example of turning massive datasets into actionable insights.

The complete source code, documentation, and architecture explanations are available on GitHub.

Title: [Project] Built a production data pipeline that processes 7M Yelp reviews in 2 hours

I created an end-to-end data engineering project that showcases:

**The Problem:** Processing millions of reviews in real-time is expensive. Naive implementations take 30-90 seconds per page load.

**The Solution:** A two-stage architecture:
- Offline: Batch ETL + pre-computation (run once/nightly)
- Online: Fast API serving (<100ms response times)

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLite
- VADER sentiment analysis, TF-IDF keyword extraction
- K-Means clustering, Logistic Regression
- Vanilla JS frontend

**Performance Story:**
My initial implementation had N+1 query problems - would've taken 43 DAYS to process. After adding a single database index, it completed in 2 hours (500× speedup).

**What's included:**
✅ Full source code with documentation
✅ Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
✅ Setup automation script
✅ Performance optimization case study

The project is open source and well-documented for learning purposes.
