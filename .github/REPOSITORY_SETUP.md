I'm excited to share my latest project: Yelp Insights Dashboard! 🎉

This production-ready data engineering pipeline demonstrates:
✅ ETL at scale (10GB dataset, 7M reviews)
✅ Performance optimization (43 days → 2 hours!)
✅ ML integration (sentiment analysis, clustering, prediction)
✅ Modern API design (FastAPI + async)
✅ Real-world problem solving

Perfect example of turning massive datasets into actionable insights.

The complete source code, documentation, and architecture explanations are available on GitHub.

Title: Built a production data pipeline that processes 7M Yelp reviews in 2 hours

I created an end-to-end data engineering project that:
- Processes the full 10GB Yelp Open Dataset
- Implements sentiment analysis and ML clustering
- Delivers a sub-100ms dashboard experience
- Reduced processing time from 43 days to 2 hours with a single index

The project includes full source code, architecture diagrams, and a detailed performance optimization story.

Would love feedback from the community!
